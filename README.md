# AWS Account Switcher - Extension for Safari

This extension for Safari is a port of the work done by tilfin in https://github.com/tilfin/aws-extend-switch-roles
Original work on Safari extension is thanks to rmatec in https://github.com/rmatec/aws-account-switcher-safari-extension and now maintained by Aaron Parker.

## Documentation

The features are the same as the Chrome and Firefox plugins. The documentation can be found at https://github.com/tilfin/aws-extend-switch-roles

## Installation

You can install this extension for Safari from the Mac App Store in this link https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/aws-account-switcher/id1535264792?mt=12
Unfortunately Apple phased out the old extension format which allowed to be installed independently.
However, you can bypass the Mac App Store by cloning the project and building and installing the extension from Xcode yourself.

## Versioning

The Safari extension will follow the same versions as the Chrome and Firefox plugins in https://github.com/tilfin/aws-extend-switch-roles. The versioning there uses 3 digits (e. g. v2.0.5). This project will use 4 digits in order to apply Safari only fixes (e. g. v2.0.5.1)

The versioning might change in the future if this project drifts enough from the work done by Tilfin.

## Known issues

- The extension cannot be configured in private mode as the configuration window fails to open. However, you can configure it in normal mode and it will work as expected in private mode.
